/*
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows you to describe UI structure using a syntax that looks like HTML, but it actually becomes JavaScript.

Why JSX is used

Easier to read and write UI code
Combines logic + UI in one place
Helps avoid complex DOM manipulation

Important points

JSX is not required, but highly recommended in React
Browsers don’t understand JSX directly
JSX is converted to JavaScript using tools like Babel

JSX makes React code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain
